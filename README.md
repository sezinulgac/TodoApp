#  Todo List

This is a simple Todo List web application built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and manage their tasks easily. 
All tasks are saved in the browser's Local Storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page. 
The app features a clean and responsive design, confirmation prompts for deletions, and an intuitive interface for managing daily tasks efficiently.
